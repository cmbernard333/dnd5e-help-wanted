            The book is dirty and water damaged and many of its pages are torn out. It appears second hand and shoddily built. It is scrawled in a child's hand.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li >Entry 1</li>
            I used some of Gran's money to buy myself a diary when I rode Wilbur to town today. I got it from a nice man town. Gran seems very mad that I used the money but I told her the merchant said that's how much Milk cost today. 
            Gran seems very mad Papa is gone. She seems even more mad that Mommy and Daddy are gone. She seems very mad she has to look after me.
            <p>
             </p>
            <li >Entry 5</li>
            <p>
                Gran found my journal today and tossed it outside into a puddle. She told me if I have secrets she wants to know them all. It seems I shouldn't write nasty things in here. Atleast Wilbur listens.
             </p>
            <li >Entry 6</li>
            <p>
                Wilbur is the best friend that I have ever. He's always happy to see me. And listens to all my troubles with Gran. And his barn is warm and dry, unlike my bed. I wonder if I run away if Gran would even miss me.
             </p>
             <li>Entry 8</li>
             <p>
                 Today I am running away. Gran can no longer be mean to me anymore. Never ever. She can be lonely with her treasures underneath her bed, which she won't let me see. I miss you mommy and daddy. One day I hope to be as nice as you.
             </p>
