        <p id="my-signature">The book appears to be slightly burned, as if someone didnâ€™t want others to read its
            contents. Towards the back are a few intact entries though the char on the spine and edges of the pages
            suggests handling with extreme care.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Midsummer</li>
            <p>
                The Morninglord does not hear me. I pray and I pray and I pray but he does not shine. I attend to the
                flock as I should. Maybe there is need of some grand gesture for him to hear?
            </p>
            <li>Fall</li>
            <p>
                I have heard tales of wolves on the outskirts of Leilon causing issue with the harvest and the hunt.
                They are much more aggressive than they have ever been.
            </p>
            <li>Winter</li>
            <p>
                <b><em>...THEY</em></b> are here. The wolves. Lead by some...I must save them. But what am I to do? I cannot fight them.
                I cannot protect my flock. Wolves among us! I shall end my life rather than be mutated by those
                creatures! There are others here. I have given them something to hasten their demise rather than become
                corrupted. I hope the Morninglord can forgive me.
